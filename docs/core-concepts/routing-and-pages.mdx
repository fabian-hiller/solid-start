Routing is possibly the most important concept to understand in SolidStart. Everything starts with your routes: the compiler, the initial request, and almost every user interaction afterward. In this section, you'll learn how to write basic routes, navigate between routes, and handle more complex/dynamic routing scenarios.

There are two categories of routes:

- UI routes, which define the user interfaces in your app
- API routes, which define data endpoints in your app

This section of the documentation will mainly focus on UI routes.

## Creating pages

SolidStart uses file system-based routing. This means that the directory path of your route files will translate exactly to the route structure in your application.

Here are a few examples of files in our directory structure and how they would translate to application routes:

- `/src/routes/index.tsx` ➜ `mysite.com`
- `/src/routes/admin/index.tsx` ➜ `mysite.com/admin`
- `/src/routes/admin/edit-settings.tsx` ➜ `mysite.com/admin/edit-settings`

We put all our routes in the same top-level directory, `src/routes`. This includes our pages, but also our API routes. For a route to be rendered as a page, it should default export a component. This component represents the content that will be rendered when users visit the page:

```tsx
export default function Index() {
  return <div>Welcome to SolidStart!</div>;
}
```

In this example, visiting mysite.com/ will render a `<div>` with the text "Welcome to SolidStart!" inside it.

[show mini demo of mysite.com with text]

Under the hood, SolidStart traverses your `routes` directory, collects all the routes, and makes them accessible using the `<FileRoutes />` component. The `<FileRoutes />` component only includes your page routes, and not your API routes. This component can be used instead of manually specifying routes inside the `<Routes />` component in `root.tsx`.

```tsx {6-8}
import { Html, Body, Routes, FileRoutes } from "solid-start";

export default function Root() {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Body>
        <Routes>
          <FileRoutes />
        </Routes>
      </Body>
    </Html>
  );
}
```

This means that all you have to do is create a route in your directory structure and SolidStart takes care of everything else needed to make that route available to visit in your application!

## Navigating between pages

While the user can enter your app from any URL that your app serves, once they are using your app, you can provide them a user experience that is designed. You need a way for the user to travel between your pages. As with any website, you can use `a` tags to add links between pages in your app. Nothing special! Lets look at an example,

#### Using links

The easiest way to add a link to another page in your app is to the use the anchor tag `<a>`. Just like you would do in a plain HTML document, you can add a `href` attribute to the `<a>` tag and we will navigate to that route in SPA style.

```tsx {3}
export default function Index() {
  return (
    <div>
      <a href="/about">About</a>
    </div>
  );
}
```

If you use an `a` tag, you have to use the absolute path to the route you want to navigate to. You might find it easier to specify the path to a route relative to the current route. There are also cases where you might want to know if the `href` matches the current route for styling purposes. For these situations, we have the [NavLink][navlink] component re-exported from `@solidjs/router`.

You can specify class names to add to the `<a>` tag when the current location matches the `href` of the anchor using the `activeClass` prop. Use the `inactive` prop to add a class name to the `<a>` tag if the current route does not match the `href` of the anchor.

```tsx {5-11,14,17}
import { NavLink } from "solid-start"

export default function UsersLayout() {
  return (
    <div>
      <NavLink
        href="./projects"
        activeClass="active-link"
        inactiveClass="inactive-link"
      >
        Projects
      </Navlink>

      // renders this when the user is on /users/1/projects
      <a href="/users/1/projects" class="active-link">Projects</a>

      // and this when the user is on /users/1/tasks
      <a href="/users/1/projects" class="inactive-link">Projects</a>
    </div>
  );
}

```

#### When the user clicks a button

There are cases where the `link` tag is not right for your navigation needs. For example,

- You want to navigate after the user clicks a button, and we do some logic.
- You want to navigate after an async process completes

For these use cases we provide an imperative [`navigate`][usenavigate-navigate] function that can be access using the [`useNavigate`][usenavigate] helper

#### Redirecting

- The primary way of redirecting from a route to another is to use the `<Navigate />` component in the tsx. For example, if you want to redirect to the home page, you can use the following code.

  - **Server**: When we get a request for this page, we will rend a [`308 (Redirect)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/308) response with `Location` header set to the home page. The browser will then do its normal redirect routine. This also helps crawlers to understand that the page should be redirected.
  - **Client**: When you navigate to this page from another page in the site, we will immediately navigate to the home page.

```tsx filename="maths.ts"
export default function InactivePage() {
  return <Navigate to="/" />;
}
```
